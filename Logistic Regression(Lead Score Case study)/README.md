# Problem Statement
Build a model where you need to assign lead scores to all the leads who are visited page. The leads having higher lead score have higher conversion chance and leads having lower lead score have lower convesion chance. The model accuracy should be greater than 80%, so that 80% leads have higher conversion rate.

# Goals of the case study
1) Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.

2)There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well. These problems are provided in a separate doc file. Please fill it based on the logistic regression model you got in the first step.
